# schoolhousetest

React clone of schoolhouse.world's tutor certification page, with some changes to record tutoring certification videos on the browser, powered by a simple Express server.

Backend is in the `api` folder, frontend is in the `client` folder.

`npm install` in both folders, `node app.js` to start the server in the api folder on port 9000, `npm start` in the client folder to start the client.
